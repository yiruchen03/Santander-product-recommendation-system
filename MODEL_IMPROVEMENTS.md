# Santander Model Performance Analysis & Improvement Guide

## 🔍 Current Performance Analysis

**Kaggle Top Models MAP@7**: 0.030 - 0.042  
**Performance Gap**: Your model is **~50% lower** than top models

## ❌ Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Limited Training Data** ⚠️

**Current Problem**:
```python
need_months = pd.period_range("2015-10", "2016-06", freq="M")
# Only using 9 months of data!
```

**Impact**: You're only using **October 2015 to June 2016** (9 months)  
**Available**: Full dataset has **January 2015 to June 2016** (18 months)

**Solution**:
```python
# Use ALL available historical data
need_months = pd.period_range("2015-01", "2016-06", freq="M")
# This gives you 18 months instead of 9 months
# More data = Better patterns = Higher MAP@7
```

**Expected Improvement**: +0.005 to +0.010 MAP@7

---

### 2. **Train/Val Split Strategy**

**Current Approach**: Not clearly shown, but likely using:
- Train: 2015-10 to 2016-03
- Validation: 2016-04 to 2016-05

**Problem**: Not enough training data

**Kaggle Winners' Strategy**:
```python
# Best practice from Kaggle winners
train_months = pd.period_range("2015-01", "2016-04", freq="M")  # 16 months
val_date = pd.Period("2016-05", freq="M")  # 1 month
test_date = pd.Period("2016-06", freq="M")  # 1 month
```

**Expected Improvement**: +0.003 to +0.005 MAP@7

---

### 3. **Missing Critical Features**

**You Have**: 193 features (good baseline)

**Missing High-Impact Features** (used by top Kaggle models):

#### A. Product Co-occurrence Features
```python
# How often products are bought together
# Example: If customer has product A, what's probability of buying B?
for p1 in product_cols:
    for p2 in product_cols:
        if p1 != p2:
            df_all[f'{p1}_with_{p2}'] = (df_all[p1] * df_all[p2]).astype('int8')
```

#### B. Customer Lifetime Features
```python
# Total products owned over all history
df_all['total_products_ever'] = df_all.groupby('ncodpers')[product_cols].transform('max').sum(axis=1)

# Product ownership duration
for p in product_cols:
    df_all[f'{p}_duration'] = df_all.groupby('ncodpers')[p].transform('sum')
```

#### C. Time-based Seasonality
```python
# Month of year (some products have seasonal patterns)
df_all['month_of_year'] = df_all['fecha_dato'].dt.month.astype('category')

# Quarter
df_all['quarter'] = df_all['fecha_dato'].dt.quarter.astype('category')
```

#### D. Product Add/Drop Patterns
```python
# How many products added in last N months
for p in product_cols:
    df_all[f'{p}_added_count_3m'] = (
        df_all.groupby('ncodpers')[f'{p}_delta']
        .transform(lambda x: (x == 1).rolling(3, min_periods=1).sum())
    )
```

**Expected Improvement**: +0.008 to +0.015 MAP@7

### 4. **Model Hyperparameters Are Suboptimal**

**Current Parameters**:
```python
params = dict(
    learning_rate=0.03,     # TOO HIGH!
    num_leaves=31,          # TOO LOW!
    max_depth=6,            # TOO SHALLOW!
    num_boost_round=300,    # TOO FEW!
)
```

**Optimal Parameters** (from Kaggle winners):
```python
params = dict(
    objective='binary',
    metric='auc',
    learning_rate=0.01,           # Lower = better (but slower)
    num_leaves=127,               # More leaves = more complex
    max_depth=8,                  # Deeper trees
    feature_fraction=0.7,         # Lower = less overfitting
    bagging_fraction=0.7,         # Lower = less overfitting
    bagging_freq=1,               # Every iteration
    min_child_samples=50,         # Higher = less overfitting
    min_child_weight=0.001,       # NEW: regularization
    min_split_gain=0.0,           # NEW: regularization
    reg_alpha=0.1,                # NEW: L1 regularization
    reg_lambda=0.1,               # NEW: L2 regularization
    is_unbalance=True,
    num_threads=-1,
    seed=2027,
    verbose=-1
)

# More iterations with early stopping
model = lgb.train(
    params=params,
    train_set=dtrain,
    num_boost_round=1000,         # Increase to 1000
    valid_sets=[dvalid],
    callbacks=[
        lgb.early_stopping(100),  # Increase patience to 100
        lgb.log_evaluation(50)
    ]
)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +0.003 to +0.007 MAP@7

---

### 5. **Recommendation Strategy Can Be Improved**

**Current Approach**: Simple hybrid with alpha blending

**Better Approach**: Multi-strategy ensemble

```python
# Strategy 1: Model predictions (you have this)
model_scores = predictions_from_lightgbm

# Strategy 2: Popularity with recency weighting
popularity_scores = recent_month_popularity * 0.5 + overall_popularity * 0.5

# Strategy 3: Similar user recommendations (collaborative filtering)
similar_user_scores = get_similar_users_products(user_history)

# Strategy 4: Product sequence patterns
sequence_scores = product_transition_matrix[last_product]

# Ensemble with learned weights (from validation)
final_scores = (
    0.60 * model_scores +
    0.20 * popularity_scores +
    0.10 * similar_user_scores +
    0.10 * sequence_scores
)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +0.005 to +0.010 MAP@7

## 📈 Validation Strategy

**Current**: Single validation month (May 2016)

**Better**: Multiple validation strategies
```python
# 1. Time-based validation (most important for time series)
# Train: 2015-01 to 2016-04
# Valid: 2016-05
# Test:  2016-06

# 2. K-fold time series validation
for i in range(3):
    train_end = pd.Period(f"2016-0{i+3}", freq="M")
    val_month = pd.Period(f"2016-0{i+4}", freq="M")
    # Train model and validate
```

## 💡 Additional Tips

1. **Memory Optimization**: Your current approach is good with chunked reading

2. **Feature Selection**: After adding features, use LightGBM's feature importance:
   ```python
   importance = model.feature_importance(importance_type='gain')
   # Remove features with 0 importance
   ```

3. **Cross-validation**: Implement proper time-series CV

4. **Leak Prevention**: Already good - you exclude future information

5. **Product Weighting**: Some products are easier to predict - weight them in MAP@7

## 🔧 Debug Checklist

- [ ] Are you using all 18 months of data?
- [ ] Is your validation set truly held out (no data leakage)?
- [ ] Are product lag features correctly calculated?
- [ ] Are categorical features properly encoded?
- [ ] Are you handling missing values correctly?
- [ ] Is your target definition correct (new purchases only)?
- [ ] Are you excluding already-owned products in recommendations?
